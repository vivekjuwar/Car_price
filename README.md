The project on GitHub presents a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression. The notebook details the preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features. It demonstrates the process of splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the linear regression model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. Additionally, it provides insights into feature importance and the impact of various car attributes on price predictions.
